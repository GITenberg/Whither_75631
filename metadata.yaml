summary: '"Whither? by Anonymous" is a reflective philosophical work, likely written
  in the early 20th century. The book explores the spiritual and moral dimensions
  of human existence in an increasingly materialistic world, reflecting on the contrasting
  values between the past and modern life. It is not merely a historical account but
  rather a critique of contemporary existence, ensuring that readers are left pondering
  profound questions about progress, spirituality, and the essence of life.  In "Whither?",
  the author gathers insights from personal correspondence dated decades earlier,
  lamenting the loss of deeper spiritual values that once underpinned human experience.
  The text contrasts the superficial preoccupations of modern society—focused on material
  advancement and physical needs—with the rich, faith-driven lives of previous generations.
  The author argues that this shift towards a materialistic viewpoint leads to an
  impoverished spiritual existence, raising serious questions about the very meaning
  of progress. Through this discourse, the book advocates for a return to spiritual
  and ethical considerations as central to human flourishing, urging readers to recognize
  the intrinsic value of faith, hope, and the pursuit of a higher purpose amid an
  increasingly shallow and distracted world. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
